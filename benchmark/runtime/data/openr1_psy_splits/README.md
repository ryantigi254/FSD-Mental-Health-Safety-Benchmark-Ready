## OpenR1-Psy frozen splits (Study A/B/C)

This directory on the Uni setup mirrors the Mac setup and holds the **frozen
JSON test splits** used by the benchmark pipelines:

- `study_a_test.json` – faithfulness vignettes with gold reasoning
- `study_b_test.json` – sycophancy prompts (single-turn: control + injected)
- `study_b_multi_turn.json` – multi-turn cases for Turn of Flip evaluation
- `study_c_test.json` – longitudinal multi-turn cases for drift

The code expects these files exactly here (paths are relative to the runtime root):

- Study A loader: `data/openr1_psy_splits/study_a_test.json`
- Study B loader: `data/openr1_psy_splits/study_b_test.json` (Single-turn)
- Study B Multi-turn loader: `data/openr1_psy_splits/study_b_multi_turn.json`
- Study C loader: `data/openr1_psy_splits/study_c_test.json`

### Source Dataset

These splits are derived from the **OpenR1-Psy** dataset, a large-scale psychological counseling dataset:

- **Hugging Face**: [GMLHUHE/OpenR1-Psy](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GMLHUHE/OpenR1-Psy)
- **Paper**: [arXiv:2505.15715](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15715) - "Beyond Empathy: Integrating Diagnostic and Therapeutic Reasoning with Large Language Models for Mental Health Counseling"
- **GitHub**: [OpenR1-Psy Repository](https://github.com/GMLHUHE/OpenR1-Psy)

**Dataset Features**:
- **19,302 dialogues** with multi-turn psychological counseling interactions
- **Joint reasoning–response pairs**: includes diagnostic & therapeutic reasoning traces
- **Clinically grounded**: aligned with DSM/ICD diagnostic standards
- **Therapeutic diversity**: CBT, ACT, psychodynamic, humanistic, and integrative approaches
- **Quality-controlled**: multi-dimensional validation for coherence, reasoning completeness, and framework consistency

The dataset integrates **diagnostic reasoning** and **therapeutic reasoning** to train and evaluate large language models for mental health dialogue generation, going beyond empathy-focused corpora by incorporating explicit reasoning traces.

### Split Generation

See the runtime `data/openr1_psy_splits/README.md` for the JSON schemas and
an example script for deriving `study_a_test.json` from the OpenR1‑Psy dataset.

Once generated, these splits should be treated as **frozen test sets** for
published experiments.

## Related Files

**Gold diagnosis labels** for Study A are now in a separate directory:
- `data/study_a_gold/` - Contains all Study A gold label files
  - See `data/study_a_gold/README.md` for details

This separation keeps the frozen test splits clean and organised.
