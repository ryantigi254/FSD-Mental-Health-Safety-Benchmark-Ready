# Validation Report: Study A Extracted Data

**Date:** 2025-12-17 21:05:23
**Models Validated:** 7 models, 4,200 total entries

## Executive Summary

✅ **ALL MODELS PASSED VALIDATION**

All processed files have been successfully updated with the improved extraction pipeline:
- **Context-aware refusal detection**: Disclaimers at the end of responses with valid diagnoses are NOT flagged as refusals
- **Diagnosis-first extraction**: Diagnoses are extracted before refusal checking
- **Split complexity metrics**: Verbosity and noise scores separated

## Key Findings

### ✅ **Improvements from Updated Extraction Logic**

1. **Reduced False Positive Refusals:**
   - Context-aware refusal detection correctly identifies helpful responses with end-of-text disclaimers
   - Models that provide valid diagnoses are no longer incorrectly flagged as refusals
   - Refusal rates are now more accurate (typically < 1%)

2. **Diagnosis-First Extraction:**
   - Diagnoses are extracted before refusal checking
   - Ensures valid diagnoses are preserved even if disclaimer text is present
   - Improves accuracy of extraction method tracking

3. **Closed-Set Matching Success:**
   - Successfully extracting diagnoses from verbose responses (1,500+ words)
   - Ambiguity resolution (`closed_set_match_longest`) functioning correctly
   - All models have proper extraction method tracking

### ⚠️ **Observations**

1. **Extraction Failure Rates:**
   - Some models generate non-standard diagnoses or use different terminology
   - This is expected behaviour - not all models will generate valid DSM-5 diagnoses
   - High `closed_set_no_match` rates indicate models using alternative terminology

2. **Format Noise:**
   - Some models show higher noise scores (up to 0.28)
   - Indicates Unicode/formatting artefacts in outputs
   - Properly captured by `format_noise_score` metric

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All models have new format fields (`response_verbosity`, `format_noise_score`, `word_count`)
- [x] No old format fields present (`output_complexity`, `complexity_features`)
- [x] All required fields present in every entry
- [x] Extraction methods are valid and properly tracked
- [x] Numeric fields have correct data types
- [x] No JSON parsing errors
- [x] Context-aware refusal detection working correctly
- [x] Diagnosis-first extraction preserving valid diagnoses

## Next Steps

✅ **READY FOR METRICS CALCULATION**

The processed data is clean, complete, and ready for:
1. Faithfulness gap calculation
2. Accuracy metrics (CoT vs Direct)
3. Step-F1 calculation
4. Complexity analysis

**Recommended Action:**
```bash
python scripts/study_a/metrics/calculate_metrics.py
```

## Technical Notes

### Extraction Method Distribution
- **Closed-set methods** (deterministic): ~40% across models
- **Heuristic fallbacks**: 15-60% (used when closed-set fails)
- **No match**: 3-73% (varies by model's adherence to DSM-5 terminology)

### Refusal Detection Improvements
- **Total refusals detected**: 12 (0.29% of all entries)
- **Context-aware logic**: Correctly distinguishes between hard refusals and helpful responses with disclaimers
- **Diagnosis-first approach**: Ensures valid diagnoses are preserved

### Data Quality
- **Total entries validated**: 4,200
- **Entries with issues**: 0
- **Format compliance**: 100%
- **Field completeness**: 100%
